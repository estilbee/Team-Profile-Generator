# Team-Profile-Generator

## About the Project
With the Team Profile Generator, you can quickly create a new HTML file that includes all of the important information about your team members by using a command-line application that generates one with ease. The command line will run you through a set of prompts that will require user input pertaining to each employee. Once the prompts are completed and the user exits the program, a new HTML file with all of the user's data will be created. Once you open the HTML file in a web browser you will notice a colored card displayed for each employee with their respective information.
